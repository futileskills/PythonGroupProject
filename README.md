Ended up chaging to a inventory contol program. Should be a little easier for yall to read and talk about.

I would "follow" and enable notifications for the repo/github. even if its just email. 

If yall need help with anything let me know. I think she will be checking git history and what everyone has done. I dont want to see yall get a zero. I can only bullshit so much to help out
